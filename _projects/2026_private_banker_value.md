Using novel data from South Korea’s largest bank, we examine whether private bankers create measurable value for retail investors. Clients advised by private bankers exhibit a 24% lower disposition effect and, among elderly clients, face fee burdens reduced by roughly 8 bps. These benefits disappear when bankers are about to be reassigned or retire, indicating that value creation hinges on incentive compatibility and the expected continuation of the client–banker relationship.

**(A)** Graph of all units and the connections between them; the dashed circles represent (equally-sized) clusters. <br/>
**(B)** Assigning clusters to treatment arms: completely randomized (CR) and cluster-based randomized assignment (CBR). <br/>
**(C)** Assigning units to treatment buckets---treatment and control---using the corresponding strategy. <br/>
**(D)** Computing the treatment effect within each treatment arm: $$\hat \mu_{cr}$$ and $$\hat \mu_{cbr}$$, and variance: $$\hat \sigma^2_{cr}$$ and $$\hat \sigma^2_{cbr}$$. <br/>
**(E)** Computing the difference of the estimates from each treatment arm: $$\Delta = \hat \mu_{cr} - \hat \mu_{cbr}$$, and the total variance: $$\hat \sigma^2 = \hat \sigma^2_{cr} + \hat \sigma^2_{cbr}$$. <br/>
